## File structure

While not strictly enforced, we recommend organizing your Solana program with the following file structure. We have found this pattern to improve code readability, separating the contract interface from its implementation. It scales well for complex contracts.

```
Cargo.toml (workspace)
⌙ api
  ⌙ Cargo.toml
  ⌙ src
    ⌙ consts.rs
    ⌙ error.rs
    ⌙ event.rs
    ⌙ instruction.rs
    ⌙ lib.rs
    ⌙ loaders.rs
    ⌙ sdk.rs
    ⌙ state
      ⌙ mod.rs
      ⌙ account_1.rs
      ⌙ account_2.rs
⌙ program
  ⌙ Cargo.toml
  ⌙ src
    ⌙ lib.rs
    ⌙ instruction_1.rs
    ⌙ instruction_2.rs
```
